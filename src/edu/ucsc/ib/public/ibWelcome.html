		<H1> What is the Interaction Browser? </H1>
		<p>
			The Interaction Browser (IB) is a web application developed in Josh Stuart's Bioinformatics lab at UCSC.  It is used to visualize and combine interaction data from a large number of datasets.  The IB organizes the individual datasets into networks that can be switched on/off in the visualization of a biological network.  The networks include datasets representing various types of data such as expression and protein interaction.

		<H1> What do I need to use the Interaction Browser? </H1>
		<p>
			 The Interaction Browser is designed to run in a web browser without the need to install any additional software.  The Interaction Browser is primarily tested on the current version of Chrome and Firefox.  Some web browser incompatibilities prevent the Interaction Browser from functioning properly on other browsers.

		<H1> Looking for CircleMaps? </H1>
		<P>
			A typical heatmap visualizes data in a samples-by-genes grid.  Each dataset is visualized in its own grid.  A CircleMap visualizes the data on a per-gene basis.  Each gene gets a CircleMap.  The data row that represents the measurements for the gene is wrapped around the node.  This is done for each dataset with each one producing a separate ring.  Additionally, the sample ordering in each ring (even across CircleMaps) is maintained so that each "spoke" in the CircleMap represents one sample's data.  CircleMaps in the Interaction Browser allow users to simultaneously view multiple datasets covering a common set of samples in an interactive network graph. To get started, check out the tutorial <a href="ibTutorialCircleMap01.html">here</a>.
